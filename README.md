# Bubble Sort
## by Yanaki Kolarov

This bubble sort implementation makes use of a do while loop which runs at least once and then continues running depending on whether a swap occurred in the previous iteration.
Once no swaps have been made after a full traversal of the array, we can be sure that the items are sorted and as such we can stop. A swap occurs when an item is greater than the item following it, causing them to switch places with one another.
